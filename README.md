Python Basics, Visualization & Regression Analysis
Project Overview

This project is a foundational Python notebook focused on core programming concepts, data visualization, and a simple real-world regression use case. It is designed for beginners and early-stage learners in Data Science and Machine Learning, with clear examples and practical demonstrations.

The notebook covers Python basics, visualization using Matplotlib, and a linear regression example that models the relationship between hours studied and marks obtained.

Key Topics Covered

Python fundamentals (data handling and operations)

String operations and type behavior

Data visualization using Matplotlib

Line charts for trend analysis

Scatter plots for real-world data

Simple linear regression (Hours Studied → Marks)

Understanding relationships between variables through visualization
